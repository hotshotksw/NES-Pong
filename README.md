<h1>ABOUT</h1>
NES Pong! Pretty self-explanatory.

This is just a small project that allows me to try out NES development using 6502 Assembly. This repository contains all the files required to properly build a very simple game of Pong that can (possibly) run on original hardware or just ran on an emulator.

<h1>HOW TO BUILD:</h1>
Download CC65 and install it. The "Getting Started" section on their page should assist you in making sure you did it correctly.

Next, download this repository, then run the compile.bat file through the folder's command line.

If everyone was set up properly, you should have a nice new .nes file to play with! Send that to a flash cart or load it up on your favorite emulator (fceux is my preferred choice for NES emulation).
